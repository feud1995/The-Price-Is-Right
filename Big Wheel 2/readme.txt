The Big Wheel v 0.6 1/28/2008

Features added:
 
*user can now right click on the main window to open a control panel
-panel includes "Viewing Angle" which will rotate the wheel on its Y-Axis to the integer angle input 
-panel includes "Spin Value" where this value, when higher makes the wheel spin longer and when the value is lower makes the wheel spin for a smaller amount of time.  If a negative number is put in the wheel will spin indefinitly and numbers above 100 are impractical.  0 stops the wheel.
-NOTE: pressing the X in the upper right corner of the control panel will close the wheel program.  Therefore, it is suggested to use the "OK" button.

Installation

There's no installation.  Basically: run the program and run it in the same folder as the glut32.dll.  That should do it.  If your computer pings and wants more, then I'm not really sure what to do.

Play around with the wheel and let me know what you think!
